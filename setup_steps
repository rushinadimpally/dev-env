PITFALL: Install ZSH using normal package manager. Chicken and egg problem with nix.
Make zsh the default (edit /etc/shells to add the new shell ) + chsh -s <path_to_zsh>
PITFALL: Need to fully logout and log back in . LOCK screen won't work

Install nix (using the default package manager: apt..)
Using nix install:
git
tmux
emacs
oh-my-zsh
powerlevel9k (zsh plugin)

Get dot files from git: https://github.com/rushinadimpally/dotfiles.git
Create symlinks for dot files (aliases, tmux.conf)

Installing oh-my-zsh:
since the zshrc file needs to know the location of the oh-my-zsh;
but the oh-my-zsh path is convoluted because of the nix paths
instead, we create a nix configuration scrpt which can create a zshrc file on the fly
and check it into the nix scripts

install the nix file
nix-env -i -f ~/dev/git/nix/pkgs/zsh-config.nix

ln -sf $(nix-env -q zshrc_rushi --out-path --no-name) ~/.zshrc


If the symbols and fonts are fucked up
make powerline fonts the default fonts for the system:
